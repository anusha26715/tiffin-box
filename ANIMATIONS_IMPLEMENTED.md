- Text content slides in from right
- Title and heading animations with staggered delays
- Button entrance animation
- **Trigger:** Scroll into view

### 3. Menu Section

## Animation Patterns Used

### Entrance Animations
- **Fade In:** Opacity from 0 to 1
- **Slide In:** Position change with opacity
- **Scale In:** Size change from smaller to full size

### Timing
- **Duration:** 0.6s - 0.8s for main animations
- **Delays:** 0.1s - 0.4s for staggered effects
- **Easing:** easeOut for smooth deceleration

### Viewport Triggers
- All animations use `whileInView` with `once: true`
- Animations trigger when 30% of element is visible
- Each animation plays only once on scroll

## Technical Details

### Framer Motion Features Used
- `motion` components for animated elements
- `variants` for animation state definitions
- `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- `viewport` with `once: true` for single-play animations
- `staggerChildren` for sequential animations
- `whileHover` for interactive effects

### Performance Optimizations
- GPU-accelerated animations
- 60fps smooth animations on all devices
- Minimal layout shifts
- Efficient scroll detection
